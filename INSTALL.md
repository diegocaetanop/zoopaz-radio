INSTALL
=======

Your mp3s or oggs should be stored in a web accessible directory - it does
not have to be inside this application. But this application and your music
archive must be on the same machine and in a web accessible directory. 
The application should have read access to your music archive.

Music location
--------------

I organize my music archive by directories. For example,

<pre>
/path/to/music/
              /Jazz/
                   /Grant Green/
                               /Alive/
                                     /01 Let The Music Take Your Mind.mp3
                                     /02 Time To Remember.mp3
              /Rock/
                   /The Doors/
                             /LA Woman/
                                      /01 - The Changeling.mp3
                                      /02 - Love Her Madly.mp3
</pre>

I can access my `music` directory via some URL. e.g. `http://www.example.com/music/`

And the streaming app from another URL. e.g. `http://www.example.com/streamer/`

When an album is played, the album title above the player is generated by looking at the path to the
file. If two slashes are in the file, it will take the last two directories of the path. Otherwise
just the last directory. For example, *The Doors > LA Woman*, would be printed.


Edit [`lib/config.php`](lib/config.php).
----------------------------------------

See [`lib/config.php`](lib/config.php) - your music will live in `$defaultMp3Dir`. This directory
should contain any level of sub-directories, but at least one more level
deep. e.g. If `$defaultMp3Dir = '/var/www/mymusic'`, then put your music in
`/var/www/mymusic/myalbum`. e.g. `/var/www/mymusic/Rock/TheDoors/L.A.Woman/*.mp3`

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for information on cover art. Each album can have a cover
art image. The directory of music should contain two images,
`cover.jpg` and `small_cover.jpg`


Edit `auth.php`, or disable.
----------------------------

This is a very simple authentication mechanism. It contains an array of username and password combinations.
Just comment out `require_once("auth.php")` in [`index.php`](index.php) if you want to turn it off.
By default after 6 unsuccessful tries you get locked out.

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for information on setting up the search index.


Set search threshold
--------------------

This is the time before an ajax query pings the server, by setting the
`threshold` variable in [`js/streams.js`](js/streams.js). Current it is set to 500 milliseconds.
You may need to tune this setting depending on your traffic or preference.


Test application
----------------

Open this application in a web browser and begin streaming your music.
