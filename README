DESCRIPTION
---

A simple mp3 or ogg streaming application. It uses PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery.

See screenshot1.png for a view of playing an album.

---
SETUP
---

Your mp3s or oggs should be stored in a web accessible directory - it does
not have to be inside this application. But this application and your music
archive must be on the same machine. The application should have read access
to your music archive.

Edit config.php.

See scripts/README for information on cover art. Each album can have a cover
art image. The directory of music should contain two images,
cover.jpg and small_cover.jpg

Open this application in a web browser and begin streaming your music.

---
Notes
---

This application relies on the file name for display your albums. Currently
it does not support ID3 tags. There is some deprecated code that used getid3
but it never worked reliably. If you know how to write ID3 support in 
PHP/JavaScript, please contact me: wjsams@gmail.com
